# SurrealDB RFCs

The RFC (request for comments) process is how SurrealDB designs and achieves consensus on substantial proposed changes.

Many changes, including bug fixes and documentation improvements can be implemented and reviewed via the normal GitHub pull request workflow.

Some changes though are more substantial, and we ask that these be put through a bit of a design process and produce a consensus among the SurrealDB core teams and community.

The process is intended to provide a consistent and controlled path for new features and changes to enter the framework. RFCs can be created by any member of the community.
